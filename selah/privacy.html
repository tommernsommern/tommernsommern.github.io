      <p>
        Selah is a faith-based iOS mobile application operated by Pro Ege (“we”, “us”, “our”).
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using Selah, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

      <h3>Information you provide</h3>
      <p>
        Selah may let you optionally submit written notes or reflections (for example, thoughts about your day).
        This content is used to generate AI-based responses inside the app.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not require user accounts.</li>
        <li>We do not require your name or email to use Selah.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Automatically collected information</h3>
      <p>
        When you use Selah, we (and our service providers) may collect technical information such as device type,
        iOS version, app version, and usage events to improve reliability and performance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AI Processing</h2>
      <p>
        If you submit text in Selah, it may be processed by AI systems to generate reflections and responses.
        Your text is processed only to provide app functionality and improve the user experience.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        AI-generated content is for spiritual reflection only and is not medical, mental health, legal, or pastoral advice.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Log Data</h2>
      <p>
        If the app encounters an error, we may collect diagnostic information (“Log Data”) through third-party tools.
        Log Data may include your device IP address, device name, operating system version, app configuration,
        time and date of use, crash traces, and other statistics.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Selah does not use browser cookies directly (it is a mobile app). However, third-party SDKs may use
        similar technologies to measure performance and usage. If you disable tracking at the OS level,
        some analytics may be limited.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Service Providers</h2>
      <p>

        to deliver the service, fix issues, and manage subscriptions.
